a program that changes hsv of image & dithers in real time

very helpful for me since i dither a lot of images & i had to fiddle with these parameters manually & it was very time consuming

### you can use any image; put it in the data folder & change the name in the .pde file

# controls:
hold click & drag on 1st img: adjust brightness & saturation

hold click & scroll on 1st img: adjust hue

right click on 2nd img: save dithered image

# other notes:
the output image was originally supposed to save to desktop, but that could get rly messy (especially if you, the ta, are grading 20 other projects). 
all output imgs save to project folder
