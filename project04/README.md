# karaoke machine
a program that detects audio from a mic & compares the pitch to a midi

sing as well as you can for the most points!

highly recommend calibrating your mic in the program before playing a song, every mic is different

## you can add your own midis!
put any midi in the data folder and add new Song(<file name>,<channel of vocal melody>,<duration of song in seconds>) to the songList
