# Midi01Edited & MidiVizEdited are the ones i tinkered with
MidiViz source: https://github.com/hamoid/Fun-Programming/tree/master/processing/ideas/2017/04/MidiViz 

for the project i'm planning to make a karaoke machine so i was brainstorming stuff for it using this exercise (scrolling notes)

also MidiViz has code that can play midi files which midibus can't... well midibus can but the solution is convoluted
