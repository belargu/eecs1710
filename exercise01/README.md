drafts: contains drafts & experiments (don't have to look)  
* clickDragRect: code i found online (made by someone else) (was thinking of implementing it to fsPaint but i decided to keep it simple)
* fsPaintSimple: i made this when i was stuck on how to make a fake UI on top of the drawing screen, but i figured it out
* screenSaver: made this to get more used to "drawing"; clicking & dragging & making lines & ellipses
* smileyWorld: initial plan before fsPaint; idk where i was going with this
* fs paint brainstorming.txt: brainstorming...
* ms paint ui.PNG: just a screenshot i made for reference
* pseudocode clicking on objects.txt: more brainstorming
* ui draft.mdp: can only be opened with medibang paint/firealpaca, this is just a sketch
